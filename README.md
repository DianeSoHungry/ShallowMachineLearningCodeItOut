# Shallow Learning Code-It-Out

This repo is created to summarize the most popular shallow learning algos from Machine Learning In Action. The scripts in this repo are not copy of the scripts from the book, I tend to implementing it at a higher level, because you have a super lazy githubber friend here. Kidding! I did it simply because I feel like that’s how data scientist deal with data most of the time. It’s a good practice!! I would also encourage you to try to implement this algos by heart with the help of the book. It kept my brain CPU running and gave me better understanding of these algos.

Apart from that, I also add some my own understanding of the algos from time to time. I will appreciate it if you ever come to discuss with me on this topic or let me know if you find something wrong in this repo.

Thanks for reading!
